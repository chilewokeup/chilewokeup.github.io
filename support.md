During the last month a series of information commissions, pacific demonstrations, TV interviews among other activities have taken place along New Zealand and the world. Currently, Chile is getting to a point where medical supplies are running out as the police attacks medical volunteers and hospitals, safety elements are also necessary for them to work under those conditions, such as eye protection and helmets. Therefore, we –us Chilean residents of New Zealand- would like to ask for your support both sharing this information and by a donation to provide our compatriots with:
<ul>
  <li>
    Food for “ollas communes” (communal cooking), where groups of people that have lost their jobs gather to feed their families.
  </li>
  <li>
    Safety elements as eye protections, gloves and helmets for volunteers from the red cross and other institutions that take care of the injured.
  </li>
  <li>
    Medical supply, mostly for first aids on the street, where bullets, tear gas and caskets are being shot a low distance (less than 10 meter) to people, to maximize the damage, as well as chemical burns caused by caustic splashed from the water cannons.
  </li>
</ul>
