A group of high school students decided to evade public transport fare by jumping the turnstiles, causing a strong repression from the government through the use of the police special forces.

This overreaction add up over the multiple cases of corruption within the police and army, a private health care and education system that fails in offering appropriate services, unless you can pay for it. Which is not possible for the 50% of the population earning less than US$500 per month.

When president Sebastian Pinera referred to his decisions, he declared to be in war against a dangerous enemy, the people of Chile. This claim, entitled the police and army to act freely out the law with the government support, leading to hundreds of illegal detentions, thousands of injuries, hundreds of torture and sexual assault lawsuits, and the iconic world record for eye injuries, almost 300 persons have lost at least 1 eye in 6 weeks.

The police behaviour is not going to stop without international pressure, Andres Allamand (Chile senate, government supporter) said the “human rights violations are necessary to re-establish public order, Mauricio Rojas (government minister) stated that ‘strong measures are required, with high costs, eve human lives”. These weeks have shown a really dark side of the police, not just been corrupt, but also oppressive and unscrupulous.  The lack of respect to human life of the Chilean police has reach a limit where other countries won’t help them, as the French government refused to help Chilean police while is using illicit substances and adding caustic to the water cannons used for disperse demonstrations.

Unfortunately, this is far from finished, the numbers keep rising at a warning rate, with almost 2 eyes lost per day. According to the UN and Human Rights Watch reports, the polices is using mutilation as a method of discouraging people off demonstration. Making everything worst when police started to attack health volunteers and shooting tear gas inside hospitals.
